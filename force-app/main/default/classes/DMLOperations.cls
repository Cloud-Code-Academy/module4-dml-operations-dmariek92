/**
 * The DMLOperations class serves as a deep dive into Data Manipulation Language (DML) in Apex.
 * It covers fundamental DML operations such as insert, update, upsert, and delete.
 *
 * This class introduces developers to the concept of manipulating Salesforce records in Apex.
 * It discusses how to use DML operations to create, update, and delete records.
 * This class uses standard Salesforce objects like Account, Contact, and Opportunity for demonstration.
 *
 * Topics covered in this class include:
 * - Understanding how to use insert DML operation to create records in Salesforce.
 * - Understanding how to use update and upsert DML operations to update existing records in Salesforce.
 * - Understanding how to use delete DML operation to remove records from Salesforce.
 *
 * Users of this class can expect to gain a strong understanding of DML operations in Apex and
 * be prepared for more advanced topics in Salesforce development.
 *
 * The methods within this class serve as practical examples of different DML operations,
 * allowing developers to learn through practice and examples.
